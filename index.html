            from the working-class suburb where he and his wife, Cheryl, first fell in love--until one fateful night when David woke
            suddenly to discover Matthew had been murdered while David was asleep just down the hall.</p>

            <p class="text-three">August Pullman was born with a facial difference that, up until now, has prevented him from going to a mainstream
            school. Starting 5th grade at Beecher Prep, he wants nothing more than to be treated as an ordinary kid—but his new
            classmates can’t get past Auggie’s extraordinary face.</p>

            coast to coast, their sound defined an era. And then, on 12 July 1979, they split. Nobody ever knew why. Until now. They
            were lovers and friends and brothers and rivals.</p>
